# StreamPro Activity Feed Enhancer
This chrome extension watches your realtime activity feed for updates. When a new event is added to the feed, the extension will beep twice. It also makes the new event more visually discernable from the older events in the feed.

Created for personal use. I've messaged the StreamPro developers about supporting something similar natively.
