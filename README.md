# StreamPro Activity Feed Enhancer
This chrome extension watches your realtime activity feed for updates. When a new event is added to the feed, the extension will beep twice. It also makes the new event more visually discernable from the older events in the feed.

### DEPRECATED
StreamPro merged with TwitchAlerts and is now StreamLabs. This extension no longer works and is no longer needed.
